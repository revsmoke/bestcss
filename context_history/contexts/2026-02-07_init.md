## Project Initialization — 2026-02-07

### Phase
init

### Summary
Project context management infrastructure created.

### Files Created/Modified
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context_history/` | Root directory for all context files |
| `context_history/README.md` | Directory documentation |
| `context_history/context_index.md` | Master index |
| `context_history/decisions.md` | Decision log |
| `context_history/prune_queue.md` | Overflow holding area |
| `context_history/install_log.md` | Installation tracking |

### Key Decisions
- Using file-system based context management: Enables grep/cat access without loading all context into memory

### State
completed

### Next Steps
- Begin project work
- Use `be-remembered-concat-context` skill at end of each session
