# Prune Queue

Temporary holding area for content that needs consolidation or review.

When tidying the context history, place content here that:
- Needs to be merged with other files
- Is unclear where it belongs
- May be redundant but needs verification before deletion

After review, move content to appropriate locations or delete if truly redundant.
